				 If assertion fails that means something went wrong and so the app quits. 
				 One reason to use assert would be if you have some function that will not behave or will create very bad side effects
				 if one of the parameters passed to it is not exactly some value (or a range of values) 
				 you can put an assert to make sure that value is what you expect it to be, and if its not then something is really wrong, 
				 and so the app quits. Assert can be very useful for debugging/unit testing,
				 and also when you provide frameworks to stop the users from doing "evil" things'
